## Overview
This repository contains three individual C# console applications developed as part of **DCIT 318: Programming II Assignment 1**.

### 1. Grade Calculator
Asks the user to enter a grade value between 0 and 100, then outputs the matching letter grade based on the scale:
- 90–100: **A**
- 80–89: **B**
- 70–79: **C**
- 60–69: **D**
- Below 60: **F**

### 2. Ticket Price Calculator
Determines the price of a movie ticket depending on the customer’s age:
- Regular ticket price: **GHC 10**
- Discounted price (**GHC 7**) for senior citizens (65 and above) or children (12 and under).

### 3. Triangle Type Identifier
Accepts three side lengths and classifies the triangle type:
- **Equilateral** → All three sides equal  
- **Isosceles** → Exactly two sides equal  
- **Scalene** → All sides of different lengths  

Includes a check to ensure the sides can actually form a valid triangle (triangle inequality rule).

## Running the Programs
1. Open a terminal in the specific project’s folder (e.g., `TriangleTypeIdentifier`).
2. Compile and run using:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
